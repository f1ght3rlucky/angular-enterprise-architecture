#  The schema of the application (example)

This reusable library is intended to express the idea that a family of related
applications typically shares a certain amount of "schema". Within Angular at
least, this usually takes the form of a set of typescript types, although it may
also take the form of something like a GraphQL schema.

This is the smallest of the example libraries, and has the greatest number of
other libraries that depend on it; that is typical of a somewhat reasonable
dependency graph.
