# Portal application

This is the portal application. It is intended to be an example of the smallest
subset of functionality, likely to be used by the largest number of people,
among the family of related applications.

Because essentially all of the features are delegated to libraries that are reused across this family related applications, there is very little code here.

Although this small example is very similar to the agent and admin applications,
it would be more realistic if this were offered with extensive mobile support,
additional attention to load time and size, etc.
